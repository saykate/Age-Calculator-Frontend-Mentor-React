## Overview
I first started this project when I was still working in vanilla JavaScript. I started learing React.js after I had finished the basic html and css structuring, so I converted those pieces into a new React project.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
This was great practice with React. It feels so very foreign right now, so this was quite a struggle. I learned a ton about using forms and inputs in this project. Obviously have a whole lot more to learn, but it was a good start. 

### Continued development

I need to keep doing React projects to try and get more comfortable using it.
